Hello, I'm Cloris. A high school student studying at an ib school in Guangdong. 
As a coffee enthusiast, I have found that people's usual love for coffee is too general, without understanding its true flavor and the story behind it. So I think we should create this website to help everyone understand it better and make good use of this resource to give coffee lovers a sense of belonging!

### More Information

I will share posters, articles and videos about coffee with all of you! Help everyone understand coffee better and become a true coffee lover! Welcome to follow
